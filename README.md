# Modelling and Simulation Assignment - Autonomous Vehicle Dynamics and Control, Cranfield University

This repository contains a MATLAB/Simulink simulation software for the flight dynamic simulation of a transonic missile system.

### Description
This Software Project was created as part of the Modeling and Simulation module, which was held by Dr. Chang-Hun Lee, Korean Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, for the students of the master course Autonomous Vehicle Dynamics and Control at Cranfield University. This repository contains MATLAB/Simulink software in which the flight dynamic model of a transonic missile has been developed and analyzed. 

The problem presented in this assignment was the modeling and simulation of a transonic missile model in MATLAB/Simulink. The lecturer provided the aerodynamic and airframe information.  This work mainly focused on modeling the system and analyzing the missile's flight dynamics and response behavior.  Furthermore, a required control law was adapted for the modeled system. For that goal, a suitable algorithm and fitting SIMULINK models should be created and afterward discussed.

### Structure

This assignment aims to model and simulate the flight dynamic behavior of a specified missile by using MATLAB/Simulink. This general aim can be separated into six primary objectives:

* Describing the general model conceptualization
* Derivative the flight dynamic equations of a missile
* Establishing the Simulink model of the missile
* Verification of the created SIMULINK model
* Searching Trimming states of the missile
* Linearisation of flight dynamic equations
* Analysing the Stability behavior of the missile
* Designing an Autopilot for the missile
