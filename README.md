# Modelling and Simulation Assignment - Autonomous Vehicle Dynamics and Control, Cranfield University

This repository contains a MATLAB/Simulink simulation software for the flight dynamic simulation of an transsonic missile system.

### Discription
This Software Project was created as part of the Modeling and Simulation module which was held by Dr. Chang-Hun Lee, Korean Advanced Institute of Science and Technolgy for the students of the master course Autonomous Vehicle Dynamics and Control at Cranfield University. This repository contains MATLAB/Simulink software in which the flight dynamic model of a transsonic missile has been developed and analyised. 

The problem presented in this assignment was the modelling and simulation of a transsonic missile model in MATLAB/Simulink. The aerodynamic and airframe information were provided by the lecturer.  This work was mainly focusing on modelling all relevant e to analyse the flight dynamics  and response behaviour of the missile.  Furthermore, a control law shall be developed for the modelled system. For that goal suitable algorithm and fitting SIMULINK models should be created and afterwards discussed.

### Structure

This assignment aims to model and simulate the flight dynamic behaviour of a specified
missile by using MATLAB/Simulink. This general aim can be separated into six primary
objectives:

* Describing the general model conceptualisation
* Deviate the flight dynamic equations of a missile
* Establishing the Simulink model of the missile
* Verification of the created SIMULINK model
* Searching Trimming states of the missile
* Linearisation of flight dynamic equations
* Analysing the Stability behaviour of the missile
* Designing an Autopilot for the missile
