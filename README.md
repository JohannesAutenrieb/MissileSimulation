# Modelling and Simulation Assignment - Autonomous Vehicle Dynamics and Control, Cranfield University

This repository contains a MATLAB/Simulink simulation software for the flight dynamic simulation of an transsonic missile system.

### Discription
This Software Project was created as part of the Modeling and Simulation module which was held by Dr. Chang-Hun Lee, Korean Advanced Institute of Science and Technolgy for the students of the master course Autonomous Vehicle Dynamics and Control at Cranfield University. This repository contains MATLAB/Simulink software in which the flight dynamic model of a transsonic missile has been developed and analyised. 

The problem presented in this assignment was the modelling and simulation of a transsonic missile model in MATLAB/Simulink. The aerodynamic and airframe information were provided by the lecturer.  This work was mainly focusing on modelling all relevant e to analyse the flight dynamics  and response behaviour of the missile.  Furthermore, a control law shall be developed for the modelled system. For that goal suitable algorithm and fitting SIMULINK models should be created and afterwards discussed.

### Usage

the isotropic and the anisotropic algorithms are both in seperated directories. In order to get an visualised test you can run the Main_isotropic_XXX or Main_anisotropic_XXX files. XXX stands for the name of the sensor fusion algorithm which is used for that test scenario.
